TextMate Bundles and Fun

## GNUGlobal ##

This is a basic bundle to add GNUGlobal support to TextMate.  [GNUGlobal](https://www.gnu.org/software/global) creates indexes of various source code trees (C/C++/ObjC/ObjC++/Java/Yacc/PHP/assembly) capturing the definition and uses of various programatic elements: functions, macros, etc.  You can then jump to a definition of an element or quickly get the list of all uses of an element.
